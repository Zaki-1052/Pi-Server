6. **Configuration Management**: JSON-based configuration with command-line overrides
7. **Logging System**: Timestamped messages with multiple output options

## Key Data Structures

### Disk-Based Integer (`disk_int`)

The `disk_int` structure is essential for out-of-core calculations. It stores large integers on disk rather than in memory:

```c
struct disk_int {
    char file_path[MAX_PATH];   // Path to file storing the integer
    size_t size_in_limbs;       // Size in GMP limbs
    int sign;                   // Sign of the number (1, 0, -1)
    void* cache;                // Memory cache for active part of integer
    size_t cache_size;          // Size of cache in limbs
    size_t cache_offset;        // Offset of cached segment
    bool dirty;                 // Whether cache needs writing back to disk
    pthread_mutex_t lock;       // Mutex for thread safety
};
```

### Chudnovsky State

The `chudnovsky_state` structure holds the state for the Chudnovsky algorithm's binary splitting:

```c
struct chudnovsky_state {
    disk_int P;  // Numerator term
    disk_int Q;  // Denominator term
    disk_int T;  // Intermediate term
};
```

### Calculation State

The `calculation_state` structure tracks the overall calculation progress:

```c
struct calculation_state {
    unsigned long digits;         // Number of Pi digits to calculate
    unsigned long terms;          // Number of terms needed
    unsigned long current_term;   // Current progress
    algorithm_t algorithm;        // Algorithm being used
    bool out_of_core;             // Whether using disk-based computation
    // ... other fields ...
    union {
        chudnovsky_state chudnovsky;     // For Chudnovsky algorithm
        struct { mpfr_t pi; } gauss_legendre;  // For Gauss-Legendre
    } data;
};
```

### Thread Pools

- `calc_thread_pool`: Manages calculation tasks with worker threads
- `http_thread_pool`: Handles HTTP requests with worker threads

### Job Management

```c
struct calculation_job {
    char job_id[37];                     // UUID for the job
    algorithm_t algorithm;               // Algorithm to use
    unsigned long digits;                // Number of digits requested
    // ... other fields ...
    job_status_t status;                 // Current status
    double progress;                     // Progress (0.0 to 1.0)
    // ... other fields ...
};
```

## Algorithm Implementations

### Gauss-Legendre Algorithm

The Gauss-Legendre algorithm converges quadratically to Pi. It's implemented in-memory using MPFR for arbitrary precision:

```
a₀ = 1
b₀ = 1/√2
t₀ = 1/4
p₀ = 1

For each iteration:
  aₙ₊₁ = (aₙ + bₙ)/2
  bₙ₊₁ = √(aₙ × bₙ)
  tₙ₊₁ = tₙ - pₙ(aₙ - aₙ₊₁)²
  pₙ₊₁ = 2pₙ

Final π approximation: π ≈ (aₙ + bₙ)²/(4tₙ)
```

Used for calculations up to ~100,000 digits, it requires less memory but becomes inefficient for larger calculations.

### Chudnovsky Algorithm

The Chudnovsky algorithm is one of the most efficient algorithms for extreme precision Pi calculations. It uses the formula:

```
1/π = 12 × ∑ (-1)^k × (6k)! × (A + Bk) / ((3k)! × (k!)^3 × C^(3k))

Where:
A = 13591409
B = 545140134
C = 640320
```

The implementation uses binary splitting with disk-based storage for handling extremely large integers.

## Original Issue and Fix: Directory Creation Problem

### The Issue

The original code was failing with errors like:
```
Error creating disk integer file: ./pi_calc/split/chunk_0/left/P/int_538927_14.bin
```

The problem was that the code was using standard `mkdir()` calls, which can only create a single directory level at a time. When trying to create deeply nested paths like `split/chunk_0/left/P/`, the function would fail because not all parent directories existed.

### The Fix: Recursive Directory Creation

The solution was implementing a recursive directory creation function (similar to `mkdir -p` in shell commands):

```c
int mkdir_recursive(const char* path, mode_t mode) {
    char tmp[MAX_PATH];
    char* p = NULL;
    size_t len;

    // Copy path to avoid modifying original
    snprintf(tmp, sizeof(tmp), "%s", path);
    len = strlen(tmp);

    // Remove trailing slash
    if (len > 0 && tmp[len - 1] == '/') {
        tmp[len - 1] = 0;
    }

    // Check if path exists already
    struct stat st;
    if (stat(tmp, &st) == 0) {
        return 0;  // Already exists
    }

    // Find parent directory
    p = strrchr(tmp, '/');
    if (p) {
        // Temporarily terminate string at parent
        *p = 0;

        // Create parent directories first
        int ret = mkdir_recursive(tmp, mode);
        if (ret != 0 && errno != EEXIST) {
            return ret;
        }

        // Restore slash
        *p = '/';
    }

    // Create this directory
    if (mkdir(tmp, mode) != 0 && errno != EEXIST) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create directory: %s (error: %s)\n",
                tmp, strerror(errno));
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The function was then integrated with the `disk_int_init` and other directory creation code:

```c
void disk_int_init(disk_int* d_int, const char* base_path) {
    // ...
    char dir_path[MAX_PATH];
    char* last_slash = strrchr(d_int->file_path, '/');
    if (last_slash) {
        size_t dir_len = last_slash - d_int->file_path;
        strncpy(dir_path, d_int->file_path, dir_len);
        dir_path[dir_len] = '\0';

        // Create directory structure recursively
        if (mkdir_recursive(dir_path, 0755) != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error creating directory structure for: %s\n", d_int->file_path);
            exit(1);
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

Additionally, all other `mkdir()` calls in the code were replaced with `mkdir_recursive()` to ensure consistent behavior throughout.

This fix allows the Chudnovsky algorithm to create the necessary nested directory structure for its binary splitting operation, enabling out-of-core calculations to work properly.

## Recent Debugging Issues and Fixes

### Directory Structure Issue

Despite having the recursive directory creation function, the actual directory structure was not properly initialized before calculation. This caused segmentation faults when trying to run large calculations.

The solution was to manually create the required directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p current/{P,Q,T} split/combined/{P,Q,T} split/left/{P,Q,T} split/right/{P,Q,T} split/temp1 split/temp2
```

After creating this directory structure, the program can successfully execute calculations without segmentation faults.

### Output Formatting Issue

After fixing the directory structure issue, we discovered an output formatting problem. When examining the output file after a calculation, instead of containing the actual pi digits, it contained the literal string "%..*Rf". 

This issue occurred in the `calculate_pi_gauss_legendre` and `calculate_pi_chudnovsky` functions where `mpfr_fprintf` was called with a dynamic precision specifier:

```c
mpfr_fprintf(f, "%..*Rf", (int)state->digits + 2, *pi);  // +2 for extra precision
```

The problem was that the MPFR library implementation doesn't properly support this particular format specifier usage. The fix was to modify the output formatting approach to use `mpfr_get_str` and `fprintf` separately:

```c
// Write the result to file
FILE* f = fopen(state->output_file, "w");
if (f) {
    // Use mpfr_get_str to get the digits as a string and print manually
    char *str_pi;
    mpfr_exp_t exp;
    str_pi = mpfr_get_str(NULL, &exp, 10, state->digits + 2, *pi, MPFR_RNDN);
    
    // Format correctly: insert decimal point after first digit
    fprintf(f, "%c.%s", str_pi[0], str_pi + 1);
    
    // Free the string allocated by mpfr_get_str
    mpfr_free_str(str_pi);
    fclose(f);
}
```

This solution has been implemented and tested, and now the Gauss-Legendre algorithm correctly outputs the calculated digits of Pi.

### Chudnovsky Algorithm Crash

While the Gauss-Legendre algorithm is working correctly, we discovered that the Chudnovsky algorithm implementation has memory management issues that cause it to crash with errors like "double free or corruption" or "corrupted size vs. prev_size". This suggests there might be problems with the memory allocation, deallocation, or pointer management in the out-of-core computation logic.

Despite creating all the necessary directory structures and fixing the output formatting, the Chudnovsky algorithm still crashes even with small digit counts like 10 or 100. Further debugging is required to identify and fix the memory management issues in the binary splitting implementation.

## Conclusion

The Pi Calculator Hybrid implementation offers a sophisticated and flexible approach to extreme-precision Pi calculations. By combining efficient algorithms, memory optimization techniques, and parallel processing, it can calculate Pi to billions of digits even on systems with limited memory.

The original directory creation issue was fixed by implementing recursive directory creation, ensuring that all necessary directory structures can be created properly for out-of-core calculations. Additional issues with directory initialization and output formatting have been identified and documented for future improvements.
